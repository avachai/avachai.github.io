<h1 style="width: 80%">How do I create a logo with AvaChai?</h1>

<p style="font-size: 16px; width: 80%">AvaChai is being chosen by hundreds and thousands of designers worldwide to create logos. Recently, however, we've updated our <a style="color: white" href="/terms" target="_blank">Terms</a>, making it slightly harder to get into the business. These updates mean companies and creators must follow certain rules, and seek permission, before using AvaChai services commercially. That doesn't make it impossible though, and that's why so many people use AvaChai. So how can you get started? Find out on this page.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; width: 80%">Until October 2021, every user creating avatars for commercial reasons must seek permission and follow certain rules prior to publishing their logo, etc. In October 2021, AvaChai is introducing the ChaiFan Membership for Business. This paid membership plan allows users to create any number of avatars for commercial use, without prior written permission.</p>
<p style="font-size: 16px; width: 80%">Without ChaiFan for Business however, you must follow these instructions in order to use AvaChai avatars commercially:</p>

<br>

<p style="font-size: 16px; width: 80%">1. Create Your Avatar at <a style="color: white" href="/create" target="_blank">avachai.github.io/create</a> for commercial use.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; width: 80%">2. Email <a style="color: white" href="mailto:avachaiofficial@gmail.com" target="_blank">avachaiofficial@gmail.com</a> to seek permission for commercial use.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; width: 80%">3. If you receive permission, you may use your avatar for commercial use. Otherwise, you cannot.</p>

<br>

<p style="font-size: 16px; width: 80%">Note: If you violate AvaChai's terms/policies, you may be banned from the service, and any permissions granted will be denied.</p>
